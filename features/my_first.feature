Feature: Running a test
  As an iOS developer
  I want to have a sample feature file
  So I can begin testing quickly

Scenario: Example steps
  Given I am on the Welcome Screen
  And I see #Audio Effects #New Image Filters #CustomFilters #Metal Basic #Metal Uniform Stream #SceneKit #HealthKit #Touch ID #VisualEffects
  Then I scroll up
  Then I scroll down
  Then I press "Audio Effects"
  Then I press "iOS8 Sampler"
  Then I press "New Image Filters"
  Then I press "CODE"
  And I wait for 5 seconds
  Then I press "Back"
  Then I swipe left
